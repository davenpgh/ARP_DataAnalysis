Elemental and isotopic ratios of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in zooplankton of the Amazon River Plume

The Amazon River generates an extensive surface plume, the Amazon River Plume (ARP), that reaches hundreds of kilometers into the Western Tropical North Atlantic. Within the ARP, distinct phytoplankton habitats are generated by the interplay of various physical and chemical factors. The impact of these factors on higher trophic levels has not been studied. We measured the elemental composition of five size fractions of zooplankton, a critical link between phytoplankton and upper trophic levels in the ocean. Specifically, we measured the nitrogen, carbon and phosphorus content, in addition to the isotopic composition (15N and 13C) of zooplankton collected during cruise EN614 in spring 2018. We found statistically significant differences in zooplankton phosphorus content, C:P and N:P ratios between planktonic habitats and day vs. night samples. Further, we will integrate these results with stable isotope data to assess the degree and nature of nutrients limiting secondary production among each habitat.
